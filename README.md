# 🎮 Number Guesser Game

A beginner-friendly console application in C# where users try to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 10. The program provides helpful feedback for incorrect guesses (e.g., too high, too low), uses colored messages to enhance the console experience, and prompts users to play again after each round.
